The first step in analysing an mass spectrometry assay is to match the harvested spectra against a target database using database search engines such as Sequest and "Mascot":http://www.matrixscience.com/, a process that renders list of peptide-spectrum matches. However, it is not trivial to assess the accuracy of these identifications.

Percolator uses a semi-supervised machine learning to discriminate correct from incorrect peptide-spectrum matches, and calculates accurate statistics such as _q_-value (FDR) and posterior error probabilities.
