Percolator requires a negative training set for the training and FDR estimation, a set of so called decoy PSMs.  Decoy PSMs are generated by a spectrum-search against a separate decoy database. It is recommended that the decoy database is created by reversing all entries in the target database, or alternatively, generated with the program "mimic":http://wiki.github.com/percolator/mimic.
